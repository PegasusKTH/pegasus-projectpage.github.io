# PegasusKTH.github.io

*Insert name here* is a tool for navigating courses and their requirements and prerequisites at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The program allows the user to search for a course that they want to take and get presented with all courses needed for that particular course in a tree format. This way the user is supposed to get a clear overview of which courses they need to take before they can take the course they searched for. 

The product was developed as a project for the course II1305  Project in Information and Communication Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
